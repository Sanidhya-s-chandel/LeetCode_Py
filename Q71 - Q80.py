# Q71.) Simplify Path

# You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.

# The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:

# A single period '.' represents the current directory.
# A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.
# Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.
# Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.
# The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:

# The path must start with a single slash '/'.
# Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.
# The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.
# The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.
# Return the simplified canonical path.

# Example 1:

# Input: path = "/home/"

# Output: "/home"

# Explanation:

# The trailing slash should be removed.

# Example 2:

# Input: path = "/home//foo/"

# Output: "/home/foo"

# Explanation:

# Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

# Example 3:

# Input: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"

# Output: "/home/user/Pictures"

# Explanation:

# A double period ".." refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).

# Example 4:

# Input: path = "/../"

# Output: "/"

# Explanation:

# Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.

# Example 5:

# Input: path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"

# Output: "/.../b/d"

# Explanation:

# "..." is a valid name for a directory in this problem.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= path.length <= 3000
# path consists of English letters, digits, period '.', slash '/' or '_'.
# path is a valid absolute Unix path.

# Q80.) Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

# Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

# Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

# Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

# Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

# Custom Judge:

# The judge will test your solution with the following code:

# int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
# int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

# int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

# assert k == expectedNums.length;
# for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
#     assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
# }
# If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
# Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
# Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
# It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
# Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
# Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
# It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
