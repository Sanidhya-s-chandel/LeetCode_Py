# Q91.) Decode Ways

# You have intercepted a secret message encoded as a string of numbers. The message is decoded via the following mapping:

# "1" -> 'A'

# "2" -> 'B'

# ...

# "25" -> 'Y'

# "26" -> 'Z'

# However, while decoding the message, you realize that there are many different ways you can decode the message because some codes are contained in other codes ("2" and "5" vs "25").

# For example, "11106" can be decoded into:

# "AAJF" with the grouping (1, 1, 10, 6)
# "KJF" with the grouping (11, 10, 6)
# The grouping (1, 11, 06) is invalid because "06" is not a valid code (only "6" is valid).
# Note: there may be strings that are impossible to decode.

# Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. If the entire string cannot be decoded in any valid way, return 0.

# The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "12"

# Output: 2

# Explanation:
# "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "226"

# Output: 3

# Explanation:
# "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

# Example 3:
# Input: s = "06"

# Output: 0

# Explanation:
# "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06"). In this case, the string is not a valid encoding, so return 0.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 100
# s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

    def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        if n == 0:
            return 0

        prev_prev = 0

                curr = 0
            else:
                curr = prev
                if (i + 1 < n) and (s[i] == "1" or (s[i] == "2" and s[i + 1] in "0123456")):
                    curr += prev_prev
            prev_prev = prev
            prev = curr
        return prev

# Q92.) Reverse Linked List II

# Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

# Example 1:

# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
# Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
# Example 2:

# Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
# Output: [5]
 
# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is n.
# 1 <= n <= 500
# -500 <= Node.val <= 500
# 1 <= left <= right <= n
 
# Follow up: Could you do it in one pass?

# Q93.) Restore IP Addresses

# A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between 0 and 255 (inclusive) and cannot have leading zeros.

# For example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses, but "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312" and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.
# Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into s. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in s. You may return the valid IP addresses in any order.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "25525511135"
# Output: ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "0000"
# Output: ["0.0.0.0"]
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "101023"
# Output: ["1.0.10.23","1.0.102.3","10.1.0.23","10.10.2.3","101.0.2.3"]
 
# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 20
# s consists of digits only.
