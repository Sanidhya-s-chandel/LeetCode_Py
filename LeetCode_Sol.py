# Q1) Two Sum

# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

# You can return the answer in any order.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
# Output: [1,2]
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
# Output: [0,1]

# sol_1}

# with Time Complexity O(n^2)

# Q2) ADD Two Numbers

# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

# Example 1:


# Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
# Output: [7,0,8]
# Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
# Example 2:

# Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
# Output: [0]
# Example 3:

# Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]

# Q4) Median of Two Sorted Arrays

# Example 2:

# Q8.) String to Integer (atoi)

# Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

# The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

# Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
# Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity is neither present.
# Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
# Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.
# Return the integer as the final result.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "42"

# Output: 42

# Explanation:

# The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
# Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
#          ^
# Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
#          ^
# Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
#            ^
# Example 2:

# Input: s = " -042"

# Output: -42

# Explanation:

# Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
#             ^
# Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
#              ^
# Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)
#                ^
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "1337c0d3"

# Output: 1337

# Explanation:

# Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
#          ^
# Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
#          ^
# Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
#              ^
# Example 4:

# Input: s = "0-1"

# Output: 0

# Explanation:

# Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
#          ^
# Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
#          ^
# Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
#           ^
# Example 5:

# Input: s = "words and 987"

# Output: 0

# Explanation:

# Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.

# Constraints:

# 0 <= s.length <= 200
# s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.

# Example 3:

# Input: x = 10

# Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

# Output: false
# Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
# Output: true
# Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
# Output: true
# Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".

# Q12.) Integer to Roman

# Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

# Symbol	Value
# I	1
# V	5
# X	10
# L	50
# C	100
# D	500
# M	1000

# Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

# If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
# If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
# Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.
# Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.


# Example 1:

# Input: num = 3749

# Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"

# Explanation:

# 3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
#  700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
#   40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
#    9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
# Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places
# Example 2:

# Input: num = 58

# Output: "LVIII"

# Explanation:

# 50 = L
#  8 = VIII
# Example 3:

# Input: num = 1994

# Q13.) Roman to Integer

# Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

# Symbol       Value
# I             1
# V             5
# X             10
# L             50
# C             100
# D             500
# M             1000

# For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

# Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

# I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
# X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
# C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
# Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "III"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: III = 3.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "LVIII"
# Output: 58
# Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
# Output: 1994
# Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 15
# s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
# It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        roman_to_int = {
            'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50,

        prev_value = 0

            current_value = roman_to_int[char]
            if current_value < prev_value:
                total -= current_value
            else:
                total += current_value
            prev_value = current_value

# Q14.) Longest Common Prefix

# Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

# If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

# Example 1:

# Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
# Output: "fl"
# Example 2:

# Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
# Output: ""
# Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= strs.length <= 200
# 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
# strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        ans=""
        strs = sorted(strs)
        first = strs[0]
