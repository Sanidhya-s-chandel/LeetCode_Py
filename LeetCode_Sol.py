# Q1) Two Sum

# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

# You can return the answer in any order.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
# Output: [1,2]
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
# Output: [0,1]

# sol_1}

# with Time Complexity O(n^2)

# Q2) ADD Two Numbers

# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

# Example 1:


# Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
# Output: [7,0,8]
# Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
# Example 2:

# Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]

# Q8.) String to Integer (atoi)

# Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

# The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

# Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
# Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity is neither present.
# Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
# Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.
# Return the integer as the final result.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "42"

# Output: 42

# Explanation:

# The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
# Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
#          ^
# Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
#          ^
# Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
#            ^
# Example 2:

# Input: s = " -042"

# Output: -42

# Explanation:

# Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
#             ^
# Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
#              ^
# Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)
#                ^
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "1337c0d3"

# Output: 1337

# Explanation:

# Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
#          ^
# Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
#          ^
# Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
#              ^
# Example 4:

# Input: s = "0-1"

# Output: 0

# Explanation:

# Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
#          ^
# Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
#          ^
# Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
#           ^
# Example 5:

# Input: s = "words and 987"

# Output: 0

# Explanation:

# Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.

# Constraints:

# 0 <= s.length <= 200
# s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.

# Example 3:

# Input: x = 10

# Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
# Output: true
# Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
# Output: true
# Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".

# Q12.) Integer to Roman

# Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

# Symbol	Value
# I	1
# V	5
# X	10
# L	50
# C	100
# D	500
# M	1000

# Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

# If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
# If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
# Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.
# Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.


# Example 1:

# Input: num = 3749

# Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"

# Explanation:

# 3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
#  700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
#   40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
#    9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
# Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places
# Example 2:

# Input: num = 58

# Output: "LVIII"

# Explanation:

# 50 = L
#  8 = VIII
# Example 3:

# Q13.) Roman to Integer

# Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

# Symbol       Value
# I             1
# V             5
# X             10
# L             50
# C             100
# D             500
# M             1000

# For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

# Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

# I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
# X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
# C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
# Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "III"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: III = 3.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "LVIII"
# Output: 58
# Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
# Output: 1994
# Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 15
# s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
# It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

# k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

# You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

# Example 1:

# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
# Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
# Example 2:

# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
# Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
 
# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is n.
# 1 <= k <= n <= 5000
# 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
 
# Follow-up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?

# 26.) Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

# Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

# Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

# Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
# Return k.
# Custom Judge:

# The judge will test your solution with the following code:

# int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
# int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

# int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

# assert k == expectedNums.length;
# for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
#     assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
# }
# If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,1,2]
# Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
# Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
# It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
# Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
# Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
# It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 
# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
# -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
# nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

# 27.) Remove Element

# Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

# int val = ...; // Value to remove
# int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
#                             // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

# for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
#     assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
# }
# If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

# The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

# 29.) Divide Two Integers

# Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

# The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.

# Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

# Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231, 231 − 1]. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 231 - 1, then return 231 - 1, and if the quotient is strictly less than -231, then return -231.

# Example 1:

# Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.
# Example 2:

# Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
# Output: -2
# Explanation: 7/-3 = -2.33333.. which is truncated to -2.
 
# Constraints:

# -231 <= dividend, divisor <= 231 - 1
# divisor != 0

# 30.) Substring with Concatenation of All Words

# You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.

# A concatenated string is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.

# For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. "acdbef" is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.
# Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]

# Output: [0,9]

# Explanation:

# The substring starting at 0 is "barfoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
# The substring starting at 9 is "foobar". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]

# Output: []

# Explanation:

# There is no concatenated substring.

# Example 3:

# Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]

# Output: [6,9,12]

# Explanation:

# The substring starting at 6 is "foobarthe". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar","the"].
# The substring starting at 9 is "barthefoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","the","foo"].
# The substring starting at 12 is "thefoobar". It is the concatenation of ["the","foo","bar"].

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 104
# 1 <= words.length <= 5000
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
# s and words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
