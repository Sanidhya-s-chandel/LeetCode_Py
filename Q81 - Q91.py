# Q81.) Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

# There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).

# Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].

# Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.

# You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
# Output: false
 
# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
# -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
# nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
# -104 <= target <= 104

# Q87.) Scramble String

# We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

# If the length of the string is 1, stop.
# If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
# Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
# Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
# Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.
# Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.

# Example 1:

# Input: s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
# Output: true
# Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
# "great" --> "gr/eat" // divide at random index.
# "gr/eat" --> "gr/eat" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
# "gr/eat" --> "g/r / e/at" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
# "g/r / e/at" --> "r/g / e/at" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
# "r/g / e/at" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide "at" to "a/t".
# "r/g / e/ a/t" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
# The algorithm stops now, and the result string is "rgeat" which is s2.
# As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.
# Example 2:

# Input: s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"
# Output: false
# Example 3:

# Input: s1 = "a", s2 = "a"
# Output: true
 
# Constraints:

# s1.length == s2.length
# 1 <= s1.length <= 30
# s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
