# Q81.) Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

# There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).

# Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].

# Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.

# You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
# Output: false
 
# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
# -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
# nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
# -104 <= target <= 104

    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
